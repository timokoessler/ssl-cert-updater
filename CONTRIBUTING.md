## Running in development mode

-   The application requires a MongoDB instance to run.
-   Run the command `npm run dev-server` to start the backend and frontend in development mode.
-   In development mode (`NODE_ENV != production`), the frontend will **not** be served by the backend like in production
-   The frontend will be served by the Astro dev server on port 3001.
-   The backend port is configured in the .env file and defaults to 3000.
-   Before you can run the server, you need to create a .env file. For that you can use the CLI by running `npm run cli` in the backend directory.
-   The command `npm run dev` will run the backend, frontend and the client software. You must configure the client using the Web UI before you can run it successfully.
